# Abstract
Will be updated soon.

# Results
Will be added after publishing

# How to use the code
Please install requirements.txt or Python dependencies separately.
Update paths to the processed dataset and path to save experiment results.
## Dataset 

```
- path_to\blur_dataset
      - training
           -- artifact_free
            -- blur
      - validation
            -- artifact_free
            -- blur
       - test
            -- artifact_free
            -- blur
```

- Train models using train_dcnn.py for SOTA DCNNs mentioned in the paper
- Train DKL models using train_dkl.py, choosing specific architectures and hyperparameters.
- Train Baseline models using train_baseline.py

- Use paths to experiment directories for best_weights.dat and run inference.py for test set, TCGAFocus and FocusPath
- Use predicted excel sheets to create confidence plots using plot_confidence.py
  
# Publically available datasets
- FocusPath: https://zenodo.org/records/3926181
- TCGAFocus: https://zenodo.org/records/3910757
  
Use transform_tcga.py to transform the dataset for running inference models.

## Private Dataset      
EMC dataset mentioned in the paper will soon be released and link will be added here.
   
# How to cite our Work
The code is released free of charge as open-source software under the GPL-3.0 license. Bibtex citations will be made available soon.
